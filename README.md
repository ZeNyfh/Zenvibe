# Zenvibe

Discord bot, written in java using JDA and lavaplayer for audio functionality. Has various site support, custom (user-defined)
dj users or roles and some other cool features for you to play with once you [invite](http://zenvibe.ddns.net/) or self-host the bot.

## Language support:
* English 100% - ZeNyfh
* Polish 100% - ZeNyfh
* Dutch 98% - etherealelysia
* Danish 100% - SharkRainstorm
* Spanish 98% - Nois

## Requirements

* [JDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21&package=jdk)

## Usage

Make sure to define a token and change any parameters you wish to change (such as the bot colour) within the .env file.
If there is no .env file, try running the bot once. It will proceed to create any missing files.

Run the bot using the latest included .jar file in releases or compile the jar yourself from source.

## Java Installation

JDK 21 can be acquired from [Temurin by Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21&package=jdk) or from other trusted sources.

## Note / Help

If you have any problems with self-hosting or using the bot, contact me on discord `@ZeNyfh`
