web.devportal.description=__**No features will ever be behind a paywall!**__\n\nZenvibe may just be another music bot to you at first, but I assure you that it is different from all of the other choices out there!\n\n- To change the language, use /language!\n- You can play entire playlists, albums, or single songs from many sites! **Inlcuding discord links and attached files!**\n- Have many songs in the queue from different sources? No problem! Use the `export` command!  \nYou can then play the given txt file with the bot by attaching the file to the play command!\n- Have annoying friends which keep skipping the song you like? No problem! There is a DJ system which allows for addition of single users, and entire roles! \n- Do you **HATE** that specific part in the song? No problem! You can use the seek command to skip to a certain part in the song, `seek 2:38`\n- Do you want to quickly pause the song? That can be done too!\n- Want to see how long the song has left? Use the `nowplaying` command!\n- Do long command names annoy you? There are many prefixes for you to use! You can see them all using the `help` command! *Some of which include `p`, `np`, `fs`, `v`, `rem`, `dc`,  and `clearq`.*\n- Do you want to use **slash commands**? Those are supported!\n- Do you hate slash commands or are they too hard to use? You can **ping** the bot, or **reply** to it to use commands! \n- Do you have a feature request or bug to report? No need to make an issue on github, just use the `bug` command to send a message to me!
